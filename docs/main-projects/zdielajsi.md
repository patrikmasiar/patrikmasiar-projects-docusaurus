## Overview
Share It is a web and mobile application. The first thought arose when my colleagues and I discussed how to send photos between iOS and an Android device in full quality.
As a developers we knew that we can create an application that will do that.
So my colleague [Matej, "Juff",](https://juffalow.com/) created an [API and web application](https://github.com/juffalow/zdielaj-si). My part was to create mobile application.

## API and Web application
The API is created in NodeJS. Frontend part is in ReactJS.

## Mobile application
Mobile application is created in React-native and it is available in the App Store and Google Play. In the application, the users are able to upload photos and create an album, generete link and share it directly to the friends. Also it is possible to download photos from the album URL.
